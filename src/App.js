        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
        <p>
          I'm Ji, and being a middle child I felt strongly about helping those
          around me (AKA my siblings). Joining healthcare and working with
          patients came naturally to me and was gratifying. However, my
          perspective for "helping" shifted grately during COVID.
        </p>
        <p>
          When NYC implemented a mandatory shutdown, I took over my parents'
          laundromat. Opening and closing the store, I greeted each customer and
          told them of the rules our family thought would best serve the
          community:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wearing a mask - free ones were provided.</li>
          <li>
            To leave the store after placing clothes in washer or dryer to avoid
            crowds.
          </li>
          <li>To fold clothes at home, once again to avoid crowds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Taking this initiative had some tough moments, where customers would
          push back. However, by consistently explaining that these rules were
          for us to keep everyone as safe as possible the community started to
          change. Within 2 weeks customers and regulars would pop their heads in
          to say,
        </p>
        <p>"Stay safe."</p>
        <p>
          Seeing the impact I can have in preventative vs treatment made me
          consider switching to tech. I wanted to work in a space where I can
          have a greater reach to uplift communities. Utilizing tech to help
          others became a goal.

          I joined Grace Hopper at Full Stack Academy where I went from archaic
          to tech literate and learned the joys of tech memes :) My strong sense
          of teamwork from years in NYC clinics brought my small team projects
          to life. Currently I am focusing on my solo projects while devling
          deeper into new technologies.
